The White Rabbit currently supports exporting game data to a PDF file. To do so, simply run ``!pdf`` at any point after the game has ended. This feature works even if the bot was not present during the game and was added later, as long as the channels have the same names as those in the template and the filenames of the images match the bot's references. However, if any of the players leave the server or no longer have their nickname/role from the game, the PDF output will be incorrect or fail.
