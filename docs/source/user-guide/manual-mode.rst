Manual Mode
***********

Manual mode allows the facilitator finer control over how a game runs by
waiting for the user to call certain functions instead of having the bot
call them automatically. To display the current gameplay mode,
run ``!auto`` with no arguments. To enable manual mode,
run ``!auto off``. To turn automatic mode back on again, simply enter the
command ``!auto on``.
