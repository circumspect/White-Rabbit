Manual Mode
***********

Manual mode allows the facilitator finer control over how a game runs by
waiting for the user to call certain functions instead of having the bot
call them automatically. To display the current gameplay mode,
run ``!auto`` with no arguments. To enable manual mode,
run ``!auto off``. To turn automatic mode back on again, simply enter the
command ``!auto on``. This should be done before running ``!init``.

.. note::
   Manual mode commands are hidden from ``!help`` while in automatic mode.
   To see them in the list, run ``!help`` after calling ``!auto off``.


Alice
=====

In automatic mode, the bot will send a random poster during initialization.
However, it will not choose one in manual mode. To choose a random poster
and send it, call ``!alice``. To choose a specific poster to send, call it
with a number from 1-10, e.g. ``!alice 4``. The posters can be found in
``White-Rabbit/resources/Images/Missing Person Posters/``. This command
must be run before starting the game.


Motives
=======

In manual mode, the bot will not assign motives automatically. To shuffle the
motive cards, run ``!shuffle_motives``. The output will be logged in the
console, so you can see which motives have been given to which characters.
You may run this as many times as you wish. When you are happy with the
motives, send the cards to the players' clue channels by calling
``!send_motives``.


Clue Setup
==========

Clue setup can be done in the same way as in automatic mode, by
calling ``!setup_clues``, or you may manually shuffle the clue piles and times.
To assign clue times, call ``!assign_clues``. To shuffle which clues get
pulled at the specific times, call ``!shuffle_clues``. As with
``!shuffle_motives``, these commands can be run as many times as you like,
and the output will be logged to console.


Gameplay
========

After setup, gameplay proceeds normally. However, players will have to draw
their clues by hand. For example, if the timer is at 45 minutes and you have
the 45 minute clue, you would call ``!clue 45``. If enough time has passed
after a player was supposed to draw their clue and the clue has not been
drawn, the bot will send a reminder to their clues channel.

.. note::
   In manual mode, any player can draw any clue at any time. This allows the
   players to decide amongst themselves who gets which clues, overriding the
   distribution generated by the bot. However, they should be careful not to
   draw clues out of order or draw any individual clue multiple times, as this
   may cause issues with gameplay and will likely also break the PDF export
   functionality. Also note that the PDF export relies on no player having
   more than three clues, not including the 90 minute clue given to Charlie
   Barnes.
