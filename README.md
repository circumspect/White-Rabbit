## Translations Wanted

If you would like to contribute translations, fork the repository, copy
`english.json` in the `localization` folder, translate the values (leave
the keys intact), and open a pull request. For an example, see the
(incomplete) French translation in `french.json`. Note that changing the
names of the channels will require making a new Discord template.
