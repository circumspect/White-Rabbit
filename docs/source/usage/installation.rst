============

Download the zip from github `here <https://github.com/Chenkail/White-Rabbit/archive/master.zip>`_ and extract the files to a directory of your choice.

Create a new Discord bot as follows:

Log in to the Discord Developer portal at https://discord.com/developers/applications. Click on "New Application" and name it "The White Rabbit". Then click on the Bot tab and click "Add Bot". You may optionally add the bot icon here. Copy the token using the button next to the icon. Create a file named ``token.txt`` in the bot's root directory and paste the token in. Now create another file named ``dev_ids.txt`` in the root directory and save it.

Now, create a new Discord server using the following template: https://discord.new/YD7aEUr8AdBQ.
