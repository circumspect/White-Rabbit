================

Create a new Discord bot as follows:

Log in to the Discord Developer portal at https://discord.com/developers/applications. Click on "New Application" and name it "The White Rabbit". Then click on the Bot tab and click "Add Bot". You may optionally add the bot icon here. Copy the token using the button next to the icon. Create a file named token.txt in the bot's root directory and paste the token in. Now create another file named dev_ids.txt in the root directory and save it.

Now, create a new Discord server using the following template: https://discord.new/YD7aEUr8AdBQ. 


**Playing the game**

To run the bot, open a shell window and enter the following::

   python3 /path/to/src

Where /path/to/src is the path to the src folder in the bot's root directory
