Admin Commands

This page documents the commands available for admins of servers in which the bot is running. Users who do not have admin permissions in the discord server will not be able to run these commands.

Resetting the server
====================

You can wipe all messages from the server using ``!wipe``. This is useful if, for example, you called ``!init`` twice and now have two copies of each character and motive card in the clues channels.
