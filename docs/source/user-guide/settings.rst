Changing Gameplay Settings
**************************

The White Rabbit has the following settings which can be changed before running a game:

Automatic/Manual
================

The bot runs in automatic mode by default, but this can be disabled. For more information on manual mode, see :doc:`manual-mode`


Timer settings
==============

The bot keeps a countdown timer from when the game was started. To display the timer, run ``!timer``. The bot will default to sending timer messages every 10 seconds, but you can modify this by specifying the number of seconds between messages after the command, e.g. ``!timer 30``. This value cannot be lower than 10, to avoid spam and Discord rate limiting.
