# Fonts

The bot uses Built Titling for the headings on the PDF output and Abel for
 everything else. Alice is Missing uses (as far as I can tell) Built Titling
 for headings/bold text and DIN Condensed for the rest. I used Abel because
 it was the closest free font I could find to the original used on the cards.
