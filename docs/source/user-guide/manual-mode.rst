Manual mode
***********

Manual mode allows the facilitator finer control over how a game runs by waiting for the user to call certain functions instead of having the bot call them automatically. To display the current gameplay mode, run ``!auto`` with no arguments. To enable manual mode, call ``!auto off``. To turn automatic mode back on again, simply enter the command ``!auto on``.
