**************************
Changing Gameplay Settings
**************************

The White Rabbit has the following settings which can be changed before
running a game:

Automatic/Manual
================

The bot runs in automatic mode by default, but this can be disabled. For more
information on manual mode, see :doc:`manual-mode`


Timer settings
==============

The bot keeps a countdown timer from when the game was started. To display
the timer, run ``!timer``. The bot will default to sending timer messages
every 10 seconds, but you can modify this by specifying the number of seconds
between messages after the command, e.g. ``!timer 30``. This value cannot be
lower than 10, to avoid spam and Discord rate limiting.


Endings
=======

You may wish to disable certain endings due to their content. The link below
explains how to do so, should you so choose.
